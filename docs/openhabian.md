# openHABian - Hassle-free openHAB Setup
The Raspberry Pi and other small single-board computers are quite famous platforms for openHAB.
However, setting up a fully working Linux system with all recommended packages and openHAB recommendations is a **boring task** taking quite some time and **Linux newcomers** shouldn't worry about these technical details.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic;"><q>A home automation enthusiast doesn't have to be a Linux enthusiast!</q></p>

openHABian aims to provide a **self-configuring** Linux system setup specific to the needs of every openHAB user.
To that end, the project provides two things:

*   Complete **SD-card images pre-configured with openHAB** and many other openHAB- and Hardware-specific preparations for the Raspberry Pi
*   The openHABian Configuration Tool to set up and configure openHAB and many related things on any Debian/Ubuntu based system

## Quick Start
Here you'll find supported and tested installation platforms and instructions.

### Raspberry Pi (Prepackaged SD Card Image)
**Flash, plug, wait, enjoy:**
The provided image is based on the [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) (previously called Raspbian) standard system.
On first boot the system will set up openHAB and the mentioned settings and tools.
All packages will be downloaded in their newest version and configured to work without further modifications.
The whole process will take a few minutes, then openHAB and all other needed tools to get started will be ready to use without further configuration steps.
openHABian is designed as a headless system, you will not need a display or a keyboard.

Learn more about the Raspberry Pi as your platform for openHAB and about the requirements over in our [Raspberry Pi article](rasppi.html).

**Setup:**

-   [Download the latest "openHABian" SD card image file](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/releases) (Note: the file is *xz* compressed)
-   Write the image to your SD card (e.g. with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), able to directly work with *xz* files)
-   Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi, connect Ethernet ([WiFi also supported](#wifi-based-setup-notes)) and power on.
-   Wait approximately **15-45 minutes** for openHABian to do its magic. <br>(You can check the progress in your web-browser [here](http://openhab).)
-   Enjoy!


-   The device will be available under its IP or via the local DNS name `openhab`
-   [Connect to the openHAB 2 dashboard](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/packages.html): [http://openhab:8080](http://openhab:8080)
-   [Connect to the Samba network shares](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/linux.html#mounting-locally) with username `openhabian` and password `openhabian`
-   Connect to the openHAB Log Viewer (frontail): [http://openhab:9001](http://openhab:9001)
-   If you encounter any setup problem, [please continue here](#successful)

You can stop reading now, openHABian has installed and configured your openHAB system and you can start to use it right away.
If you want to get in touch with the system or want to install one of the previously mentioned optional features, come back here later.

Ready for more?
[Connect to your Raspberry Pi SSH console](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/windows.md) using the username `openhabian` and password `openhabian`.
You will see the following welcome screen:

➜ Continue at the ["openHABian Configuration Tool"](#openhabian-configuration-tool) chapter below!

<a id="manual-setup"></a>
### Other Linux Systems (add openHABian just like any other software)
openHABian is also supposed to run on generic Debian/Ubuntu based systems on x86 and some ARM hardware platforms.
Start with a fresh installation of your operating system, login and run

```shell
# start shell as root user
sudo bash
```

then start installation

```shell
# install git - you can skip this if it's already installed
apt-get update
apt-get install git

# download, link and create config file
git clone -b stable https://github.com/openhab/openhabian.git /opt/openhabian
ln -s /opt/openhabian/openhabian-setup.sh /usr/local/bin/openhabian-config
cp /opt/openhabian/openhabian.conf.dist /etc/openhabian.conf
```

Edit `/etc/openhabian.conf` to match your needs, then use

```shell
openhabian-config unattended
```

to get the automated openHABian installation going.

Please note that we cannot test HW/OS combos upfront so there is no support / no guarantee for this work as explained in the [README](../README.md).
Don't be too disappointed if you run into errors. Drop us a note on Github.
If the `unattended` installation does not work out, you can still try the openHABian configuration tool in interactive mode:

```
openhabian-config
```

You'll get to see the openHABian configuration menu.
Start at least with the menu options 11 and 12, then the "Manual/Fresh Setup" submenu entry is the right place for you.
Mark all components / actions you think to be of value and execute them in one go to get the full openHABian experience:

![openHABian-config menu fresh setup](images/openHABian-menu-freshsetup.png)

> Attention:
> openHABian usage on a custom system should be safe.
> Some routines might not work for you, however.
> Please be cautious and have a close look at the console output for errors.
> Should you run into errors, consult the [debug guide](openhabian-DEBUG.md).

### `openhabian.conf`
You can actually set a number of parameters before you try installing from SD card for the first time. You can also try with a different set of parameters if your initial attempt fails:

-   Flash the system image to your micro SD card as described, do not remove the SD card yet
-   Access the first SD card partition. It's a vfat/FAT-32 (Windows) filesystem so just use the file explorer of your client PC.
-   Open the file `openhabian.conf` in a text editor
-   Uncomment and complete the lines to contain the parameters you want to set
-   Save, unmount/eject, remove and insert into the RPi and boot it
-   Continue with the instructions for your hardware

### WiFi based Setup Notes
If you own a RPi3, RPi3+, RPi4, a RPi0W or any other model with a compatible WiFi dongle you can set up and use openHABian via WiFi only.
For the WiFi based setup to work, you'll need to make your SSID and password known to the system before the first boot.
The following steps are needed in addition to the setup instructions given above:

In `openhabian.conf`, uncomment and complete the lines reading `wifi_ssid="My WiFi SSID"` and `wifi_psk="password123"`

### Fake hardware mode
If to install openHABian fails because you have a non-supported hardware or run an unsupported OS release, you can "fake" your hardware and OS to make openHABian behave as if you did own that HW/OS.
In `openhabian.conf`, uncomment and complete the lines reading `hw=`, `hwarch=` and/or `release=` with the hw and os versions you want to attempt installation with.

### Debug mode
See [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section if you run into trouble installing. If you want to turn on debug mode,
edit `openhabian.conf` and set the `debugmode=` parameter to either `off`, `on` or `maximum`.

### IPv6 notes
You might encounter problems when you make use of IPv6 on some networks and systems. openHABian installation may stop or hang forever.
In that case *or if you are sure that you do not need IPv6 on your openHABian server*, you can disable IPv6.
Follow the instructions in the previous section and insert a line into `openhabian.conf` reading `ipv6=disable`.

### Auto-backup
You might want to setup openHABian to automatically backup and mirror your internal SD card to an external disk.
The recommendation is to use another SD card in an external card writer device so that in case your internal SD card breaks or becomes corrupted, you can switch SD cards to get the system back up running fast.
You need to deploy external storage / another SD card that has at least twice the size of your internal card.
Define backupdrive=`/dev/sdX` to enable this functionality right during unattended installation. Eventually define `storagedir=/storage` or any other name, too.
The first attached disk type device is usually called `/dev/sda`.
openHABian will create partitions 1 and 2 to be mirrors of your internal card and will assign the remaining space to a storage partition.
Use `storagecapacity=xxx` to override how much space to consume at most for backup storage (in MB).
The install routine will also setup Amanda to take daily backups and store them to that third partition.
In case your card gets broken and you need to switch to run on backup, get a another new SD card to match the size of the broken card (note most are not "exactly" 16 or 32 GB so your new one mustn't have less bytes than the old one. Use menu option 54 to copy your active backup card back to the new one and switch back soon. Remember you have no backup left unless you do.

## openHABian Configuration Tool
The following instructions target a Raspberry Pi openHABian setup but should be applicable to all openHABian environments.
Once connected to the command line console of your system, please execute the openHABian configuration tool by typing the following command.

(Hint: sudo executes a command with elevated rights and will hence ask for your password: `openhabian`).

```shell
sudo openhabian-config
```

![openHABian-config menu](images/openHABian-config.png)

The configuration tool is the heart of openHABian.
It is not only a menu with a set of options, it's also used in a special unattended mode inside the ready to use images.

⌨ - A quick note on menu navigation.
Use the cursor keys to navigate, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute, <kbd>Space</kbd> to select and <kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump to the actions on the bottom of the screen. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> twice to exit the configuration tool.

### Linux Hints
If you are unfamiliar with Linux, SSH and the Linux console or if you want to improve your skills, read up on these important topics.
A lot of helpful articles can be found on the internet, for example:

-   "Learn the ways of Linux-fu, for free" interactively with exercises at [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com).
-   The official Raspberry Pi help articles over at [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help)
-   "Now what?", Tutorial on the Command line console at [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)

*The good news:* openHABian helps you to stay away from Linux - *The bad news:* Not for long...

Regardless of if you want to copy some files or are on the search for a solution to a problem, sooner or later you'll have to know some Linux.
Take a few minutes to study the above Tutorials and get to know the most basic commands and tools to be able to navigate on your Linux system, edit configurations, check the system state or look at log files.
It's not complicated and something that doesn't hurt on one's résumé.

### First Steps with openHAB
After your first setup of openHABian is successful and you are able to access the openHAB dashboard, you should dig into the possibilites.
Install [Bindings](https://www.openhab.org/addons/), discover your devices, and [configure your smart home](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/).
You might want to start defining [Items](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html), [Sitemap](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/sitemaps.html) and [HABPanel](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/habpanel.html) dashboard for your home, but these are just some first hints.
Be sure to read up on the [Configuration](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/) section of the documentation pages to learn more.

### Further Configuration Steps
openHABian is supposed to provide a ready-to-use openHAB base system.
There are a few things, however, we need you to decide and act on right now at the beginning:

-   **Delayed Rules Loading** openHAB startup times can be annoyingly long. There's an optimization available that *delays* loading the rules. It quickly renames rules forth and back after 2 minutes, *effectively speeding up* openHAB startup. This is setup by default, you can disable this via \[menu option: 44\].
-   **Time Zone:** The time zone of your openHABian system will be determined based on your internet connection. In some cases you might have to adjust that setting.
-   **Language:** The `locale` setting of the openHABian base system is set to "en_US.UTF-8". While this setting will not do any harm, you might prefer e.g. console errors in German or Spanish. Change the locale settings accordingly. Be aware, that error solving might be easier when using the English error messages as search phrases.
-   **Passwords:** Relying on default passwords is a security concern you should care about! The openHABian system is preconfigured with a few passwords you should change to ensure the security of your system. This is especially important if your system is accessible from outside your private subnet.

All of these settings **can easily be changed** via the openHABian Configuration Tool.

Here are the passwords in question with their respective default "username:password" values.
All password can be changed from openHABian menu.

### Passwords
-   User password needed for SSH or sudo (e.g. "openhabian:openhabian")
-   Samba share password (e.g. "openhabian:openhabian")
-   openHAB remote console (e.g. "openhab:habopen")
-   Amanda backup password (no default, applied when installing)
-   Nginx reverse proxy login (no default, applied when installing) *For manual configuration see [here](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/security.html#adding-or-removing-users).*
-   InfluxDB (No password set by default)
-   Grafana visualization ("admin:admin")

## Availability and Backup
openHAB is designed to reliably run 24 hours a day, seven days a week - and so should be your server.
This is the right time to prepare your system for disasters such as getting hit by the SD card wearout/corruption problem which is quite common among users of single board computers such as Raspberry Pis. openHABian has a number of features built in to enhance resilience:

1.  the ZRAM feature moves write intensive parts of openHABian into RAM to mitigate the risk of SD card corruption. See [community thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/zram-status/80996) for more up to date information.
WARNING: power failure will result in some data to get lost (albeit the system should continue to run). Get an UPS.
ZRAM is enabled by default for swap, logs and persistence data. You can toggle use in \[menu option 38\].
2.  Move the root filesystem to USB-attached memory. WARNING: USB sticks are as susceptible to flash wearout as SD cards are, making ZRAM the better choice for a standard Pi to run off its internal SD card. But you can use this option to migrate your system to a safe medium such as an SSD or HDD. \[menu option 37\]
3.  Use the openHAB integrated [openhab-cli tool](https://community.openhab.org/t/recommended-way-to-backup-restore-oh2-configurations-and-things/7193/82) to interactively backup/restore your openHAB **config** \[menu option 50/51\].
4.  Use [Amanda Network Backup](http://www.amanda.org/) for full system backups, documentation [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/blob/master/docs/openhabian-amanda.md). \[menu option 52\]

Standard openHABian install enables ZRAM by default (#1). Once you attach a *safe* external medium to your system (such as an SSD), you can disable ZRAM (#1) and move the system over using menu options 37 (#2).
Finally, we strongly suggest you install Amanda (#4) right after you finish your setup. Amanda is to take care to backup your openHAB config and whole server to be able to quickly restore it when in need.
This is not done by default because it requires a number of user inputs, but you should not skip it for your own safety !

Delayed rules load will also be enabled by default. This is renaming the rules files, then after 2 minutes it renames them back. You can toggle to use this feature in menu option 44.

<a id="changelog"></a>
### Where can I find a changelog for openHABian?
The official changelog announcements are posted [here](https://community.openhab.org/t/13379/1) and [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/releases), be sure to check these out for your version.
If you want to stay in touch with all the latest code changes under the hood, see the [commit history](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/commits/master) for openHABian.
You'll also see added commits when executing the "Update" function within the openHABian Configuration Tool.

<a id="successful"></a>
### Did my Installation succeed? What to do in case of a problem?
A note on **patience**: stay calm - the openHABian setup will take 15 up to 45 minutes to complete all steps.
The amount of time highly depends on your device's performance and a number of external factors such as your internet connection.

<!--
#### LED Indication (RPi only)

During and after the first boot of your Raspberry Pi, the green on-board LED will indicate the setup progress (no display needed):

* `❇️️ ❇️️    ❇️️ ❇️️     ` - Steady "heartbeat": setup **successful**
* ` ❇️️         ❇️️❇️️❇️️ ` - Irregular blinking: setup in progress...
* `❇️️ ❇️️ ❇️️ ❇️️ ❇️️ ❇️️ ❇️️` - Fast blinking: error while setup

**RPi note:**
The progress indication via the **green Raspberry Pi LED** is currently not possible.
We will re-add the functionality as soon as the underlying issue is resolved.
-->

#### Progress Report
Watch the progress on the console or the web interface at https://<yourip>/ or <http://openhab/> if that name has become available.

Double-check the address and name with your router while you wait.

If there is absolutely no output for more than 10 minutes, your installation has failed in the first initialization phase. There probably is a problem
with the way your router or local network are setup.

You might want to try disabling IPv6.
Read on in the [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section or move on to the [DEBUG guide](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/blob/master/docs/openhabian-DEBUG.md).

It is also always possible to [connect to the SSH console](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/windows.md) of your device (after a few minutes of boot up time).
During the setup process you'll be redirected to the live progress report of the setup.
The report can also be checked for errors after the installation finished by executing: `cat /boot/first-boot.log`

The progress of a successful installation will look similar to the following:

![openHABian installation log](images/openHABian-install-log.png)

Wait till the log tells you that the setup was "successful", then reconnect to the device.

#### SSH Login Screen
If the installation was **successful** you will see the normal login screen as shown in the first screenshot.
If the installation was **not successful** you will see a warning and further instructions as shown in the second screenshot.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col s12 m5"><img src="images/openHABian-SSH-MotD.png" alt="openHABian installation successful" title="openHABian installation successful"></div>
  <div class="col s12 m5 offset-m2"><img src="images/openHABian-install-failed.png" alt="openHABian installation failed warning and instructions" title="openHABian installation failed warning and instructions"></div>
</div>

#### openHAB Dashboard
After the installation of openHABian was successful, you should be able to access the openHAB dashboard:

-   Raspberry Pi image setup: [http://openhab:8080](http://openhab:8080)
-   In any case: [http://your-device-hostname:8080](http://your-device-hostname:8080) or [http://192.168.0.2:8080](http://192.168.0.2:8080) (replace name/IP with yours)

#### What's next?
If you are not able to access your system via the openHAB dashboard or SSH after more than one hour, chances are high that your hardware setup is the problem. Consult the [debug guide](openhabian-DEBUG.md) and move on from there.

<a id="switch-openhab-branch"></a>
#### Can I switch from openHAB 2 stable to the testing or unstable branch?
openHABian installs the latest stable build of openHAB 2.
If you want to switch over to the snapshot or milestone release, please do so via the openHABian Configuration Tool.
Switching from stable to newer development releases might introduce changes and incompatibilities, so please be sure to make a full openHAB backup first!

Check the Linux installation article for all needed details: [Linux: Changing Versions](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/linux.html#changing-versions)

<a id="headache"></a>
#### Where is the graphical user interface?
I've just installed openHABian and now I'm confused.
No fancy login screen, no windows, no mouse support. What did I get into?

You are not the first one to get confused about the **intended use case of openHABian** or most other solutions based on a Raspberry Pi.
Maybe it helps to not think of the RPi as a PC as we know it.
An RPi is not (well, not *necessarily*) to be used with a keyboard and display.
Its intended use case is to sit in a corner and provide a service reliably 24/7.
You already own a **powerful PC or Mac** which you should benefit from.
It would be a shame to have a powerful computer at your fingertips and then have to **restrict yourself** to a very limited graphical frontend on another device, wouldn't you agree?

Moving on.
What we actually want openHABian to be is a **dedicated headless system** to **reliably execute openHAB** and to **expose all interfaces** needed to interact and configure it (PaperUI, BasicUI, HABPanel, openHAB LogViewer, Samba Network Shares, openHABian Configuration Tool, SSH, you-name-it).
If you know how to work with these interfaces, you are set for a way better experience than the alternatives.
The main challenge is to **get used to the Linux command line**, not even a GUI (like Pixel, see below) will relieve you from that in the long run.
If you are not willing to teach yourself a few fundamental Linux skills you will not become happy with any Linux system and should resort to a e.g. Windows machine.
However as you are willing to tinker with smart home technology, I'm sure you are ready to **teach yourself new stuff** and expand your experience.

**If** the above didn't convince you, execute the following commands to get the graphical user interface [Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-pixel) installed.
You have been warned, if there came any warranty with openHABian to begin with, it would end here.

<a id="faq-other-platforms"></a>
#### Can I use openHABian on ...?
See the [README](../README.md) for a list of supported HW and OS.
openHABian is developed for Debian/Ubuntu based systems.
If your operating system is based on these or if your hardware supports one, your chances are high openHABian can be used.
Check out the [Manual Setup](#manual-setup) instructions for guidance and consult the [debug guide](openhabian-DEBUG.md) if you run into problems.
Do not hesitate to ask for help on the [openHABian community forum](https://community.openhab.org/) !
